Explain the difference between client-side and server-side. Are JSPs referred to a client-side or server-side scripting language? Explain why?
=server-side  scripting  alows the  owner of the site to hide  the source  code that produces the interface, whereas server-side scripting allows the user to see all of the code that the client receives.
The software that runs on the server is referred to as the server side, whereas the software that runs on a user's web browser is referred to as the client side. The client side of web development is concerned with interactivity and data display, whereas the server side is concerned with behind-the-scenes data administration.
client side scripting uses the HTML, CSS  and JAVASCRIPT, while the client side uses python, PHP, java, Ruby etc
***********************************************
Client-side and server-side are terms used to describe where the processing of code occurs in the context of web development.

Client-side refers to the processing that occurs on the client's browser, or in other words, on the user's computer. It typically involves the use of scripting languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create interactive web pages. Client-side code executes within the browser and is responsible for handling user interaction, manipulating the page content, and making requests to the server for data or additional resources.

Server-side refers to the processing that occurs on the server hosting the web application. It involves the use of programming languages such as Java, Python, or PHP to build the server-side logic, which interacts with databases, handles user authentication, and processes requests from the client-side. Server-side code runs on the server and generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that is sent to the client-side for display in the browser.

JSPs (JavaServer Pages) are typically considered server-side scripting languages. JSPs are Java-based web pages that are processed by a server-side technology known as a JSP container. When a JSP page is requested by the client-side, the JSP container generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that is sent back to the client-side for display.
